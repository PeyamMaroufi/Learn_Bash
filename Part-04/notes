# Parameter Expansion
Parameter expansion means any operation that causes a parameter to be replaced by its content. Simply add $ sign to a variable.
$ echo "$RANDOM is a random number" # RANDOM is a pre-set variable in bash generating a random integer.
16568 is a random number

Sometime you need to have a curly braces. Here is the reason.
$ echo "$RANDOMs ${RANDOM}s"
32224s

What you see is that when you don't put the curly braces Bash thinks you mean another variable name. $RANDOMs variable does not exist.

Parameter expansion is very useful when using loops. More on that later.

# Parameter Expansion Tricks
The followings are some useful PE (Parameter Expansion) that can come to use in your scripting.
${param:-Payam} # If param is unset/null, substitute with of Payam. Otherwise substitute.
${param:=Payam} # If param is unset/null, assign Payam to param.
${param:+Payam} # If param is unset/null, nothing is substituted, otherwise 'Payam'.
${#param} # Length of param.
${param#pattern} # Find pattern in the begining of param and remove it otherwise do nothing.
${param##pattern} # As above but remove the longest match.
${param%pattern} # As above but look the end of param.
${param/pattern/string} # Look for pattern in param and replace it with string.
${param//pattern/string} # Look for pattern in param but replace every match with string.
${param/#pattern/string} # Look for pattern in the beginning of param and replace it with string.

# Example
$ my_string="Hi, How are you studing? How is it?"
$ echo ${my_string/How/What}
Hi What are you studing, How is it?

$ echo ${my_string//How/What}
Hi What are you studing, What is it?

$ my_string="(This) is not what you are thinking [period]"
$ echo ${my_string/#(*)/[That]}
[That] it not what you are thinking [period]

$ echo ${my_string/%\[*\]/(kidding) # Use \[ instead of [ since [ is special in Bash.
(this) it not what you are thinking (kidding)

$ variable="(this) it not what you are thinking [I hope] [period]"
$ echo ${variable##*\[} # Greedy remove everything before [ and echo it.
period]

$ echo ${variable#*\[} # Remove everything before first [ and echo it.
I hope] [period]
